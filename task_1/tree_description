# /sys/  
This  is  a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information about the kernel like /proc, but better  structured,
following the formalism of kobject infrastructure.

# /root/ 
home directory for root user.

# /snap/
Directory is, by default, where the files and folders from installed snap packages appear on your system.

# /lib/
This  directory should hold those shared libraries that are necessary to boot the system and to run the commands  in  the  root
filesystem. Directory contains important libraries and kernel modules.

# /home/
On  machines  with home directories for users, these are usually beneath this directory, directly or not.  The structure of  this
directory depends on local administration decisions (optional).

# /tmp/
This  directory  contains  temporary  files which may be deleted with no notice, such as by a regular job or at system boot up.
 
# /var/
This directory contains files which may change in size, such as spool and log files.
